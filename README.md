# Sudoku_solver
Solver writen in both Ruby and JS.

# Why do this?
I wanted to test my ability in both Ruby and then push myself to work further in Javascript. I wrote clean ruby code to make a sudoku solver that adheres to the single responsibilty principle and then translated that into javascript so that I could incorporate that logic into the frontend of a browser page. I used sinatra to make an incredible simply page which just has the 81 input fields of the sudoku board and then the solve and clear buton.
